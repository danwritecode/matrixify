# matrixify

Working with raylib to take a source image and make it load in like it's a scene in the matrix.

### Status
1. Can load images
2. Successfully quantizing the color palette
3. Successfully downcasting the resolution (making it pixelated)

### Todo
1. Need to actually decrease the number of pixels after pixelation
2. Need to add the animation
